# gofaas - Go Functions-as-a-Service

Running a Go app on AWS Lambda is easier than ever, once you figure out how to configure 10 or so "serverless" services to support the functions.

This project demonstrates how to assemble all the pieces -- a Go project, AWS config, and dev/build/deploy commands -- letting us skip the boilerplate and focus on writing and shipping Go code.

## Motivation

Functions-as-a-Service (FaaS) like AWS Lambda are one of the latest advances in cloud Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). Go is particularly well-suited to run in Lambda due to its speed, size and cross-compiler. Check out the [Intro to Go Functions-as-a-Service and Lambda](docs/intro-go-faas.md) doc for more explaination.

For a long time, Go in Lambda was only possible through hacks -- execution shims, 3rd party frameworks and middleware, and no dev/prod parity. But in January 2018, [AWS launched official Go support for Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/announcing-go-support-for-aws-lambda/) and [Go released 1.10](https://golang.org/doc/go1.10) paving the clearest path yet for us Gophers.

This project demonstrates a simple and clean foundation for Go in Lambda. You can clone and deploy it with a few commands to get a feel for the stack. Or you can fork and rework it to turn it into your own web application.

It demonstrates:

| Databases and encryption at rest        | DynamoDB, KMS                           | [code](user.go)                                       |

What's remarkable is how little work is required to get all functionality for our app. We don't need a framework, Platform-as-a-Service, or even any 3rd party Software-as-a-Service. And yes, we don't need servers. By standing on the shoulders of Go and AWS, all the undifferentiated heavy lifting is handled.

We just need a good AWS [config file](template.yml), then we can focus entirely on writing our Go functions.

## Quick Start

This project uses :

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS SAM Local](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/test-sam-local.html)
- [Docker CE](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
- [Go 1.10](https://golang.org/)
- [watchexec](https://github.com/mattgreen/watchexec)

```console
## install CLI tools

$ brew install aws-cli go watchexec
$ go get -u github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local 

## install Docker CE from the Docker Store

$ open https://store.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community
```

<details>
<summary>We may want to double check the installed versions...</summary>
&nbsp;

```console
## check versions

$ aws --version

$ aws-sam-local -v

<details>
<summary>We may also want to configure the AWS CLI with IAM keys to develop and deploy our application...</summary>
&nbsp;

Follow the [Creating an IAM User in Your AWS Account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) doc to create a IAM user with programmatic access. Call the user `gofaas-admin` and attach the "Administrator Access" policy for now.

Then configure the CLI. Here we are creating a new profile that we can switch to with `export AWS_PROFILE=gofaas`. This will help us isolate our experiments from other AWS work.

```console
## configure the AWS CLI with keys

$ aws configure --profile gofaas
AWS Access Key ID [None]: AKIA................
AWS Secret Access Key [None]: PQN4CWZXXbJEgnrom2fP0Z+z................
Default region name [None]: us-east-1
Default output format [None]: json

## configure this session to use the profile

$ export AWS_PROFILE=gofaas

## verify the profile

$ aws iam get-user
{
    "User": {
        "Path": "/",
        "UserName": "gofaas-admin",
        "UserId": "AIDAJA44LJEOECDPZ3S5U",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::572007530218:user/gofaas-admin",
        "CreateDate": "2018-02-16T16:17:24Z"
    }
}
```
</details>

### Get the App

We start by getting and testing the `github.com/nzoschke/gofaas`.

```console
## get the project

$ PKG=github.com/nzoschke/gofaas
$ go get $PKG && cd $GOPATH/src/$PKG

## verify tests pass

$ make test
...
ok  	github.com/nzoschke/gofaas	0.014s
```

This gives us confidence in our Go environment.

### Develop the App

```console
## build and start development server

$ make dev
cd ./handlers/dashboard && GOOS=linux go build...
2018/02/16 07:40:32 Fetching lambci/lambda:go1.x image for go1.x runtime...
Mounting handler (go1.x) at http://127.0.0.1:3000/ [GET]
```

```console
## request the app

$ curl http://localhost:3000
<html><body><h1>gofaas dashboard</h1></body></html>

## invoke the worker

$ echo '{}' | aws-sam-local local invoke WorkerFunction
2018/02/17 20:00:58 Worker Event: {SourceIP: TimeEnd:0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC TimeStart:0001-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 UTC}
```

Note: if you see `No AWS credentials found. Missing credentials may lead to slow startup...`, review `aws configure list` and your `AWS_PROFILE` env var.

This gives us confidence in our development environment.

### Deploy the App

```console
## package and deploy the app

$ make deploy

make_bucket: pkgs-572007530218-us-east-1
Uploading to 59d2ea5b6bdf38fcbcf62236f4c26f21  3018471 / 3018471.0  (100.00%)

```console

$ curl https://x19vpdk568.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod
<html><body><h1>gofaas dashboard</h1></body></html>

## invoke the worker
$ aws lambda invoke --function-name gofaas-WorkerFunction --log-type Tail --output text --query 'LogResult' out.log | base64 -D
START RequestId: 0bb47628-1718-11e8-ad73-c58e72b8826c Version: $LATEST

END RequestId: 0bb47628-1718-11e8-ad73-c58e72b8826c
REPORT RequestId: 0bb47628-1718-11e8-ad73-c58e72b8826c	Duration: 11.11 ms	Billed Duration: 100 ms 	Memory Size: 128 MB	Max Memory Used: 41 MB
```

Look at that speedy 11 ms duration! Go is faster than the minimum billing duration of 100 ms.

This gives us confidence in our production environment.

### Development Environment

If we want to database functions locally, you need to give the functions pointers to the DynamoDB and KMS keys. Open up `env.json` and fill in `KEY_ID` and `TABLE_NAME` with the ids of the resources we just created on deploy:

```console
## describe stack resources

$ aws cloudformation describe-stack-resources --output text --stack-name gofaas \
  --query 'StackResources[*].{Name:LogicalResourceId,Id:PhysicalResourceId,Type:ResourceType}' | \
  grep 'Key\|UsersTable'

8eb8e209-51fb-41fa-adfe-1ec401667df4  Key         AWS::KMS::Key
gofaas-UsersTable-1CYAQH3HHHRGW       UsersTable  AWS::DynamoDB::Table
```
